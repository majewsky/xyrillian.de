  <main><h1>Argh-P-M! – Dissecting the RPM file format</h1>
<p>As the first actual content on my new blog, let me tell you the story of how I went absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>On my private systems, I ship configuration as system packages. Every distribution has their own tooling and process for
building these packages, but I eventually grew tired of the ceremony involved in it, and wrote <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-build">my own system package
compiler</a>. Since I’m using Arch Linux everywhere, the first version generated only Pacman packages, but I
was determined to make it truly cross-distribution. The first step was support for Debian packages, which I implemented
in a mere two evenings (one for understanding the format, one for writing the generator).</p>
<p>Next to dpkg, the other widely deployed package format is RPM, so I set out to add support for RPM as well. If I could
write the Debian generator in two days, then surely RPM support wouldn’t take that long, either. Little did I know that
I was embarking on a multi-month endeavor (including multiple week-long breaks to restore my sanity). To add insult to
injury, I stubbornly refused to add dependencies and use existing tooling (i.e., the <code>rpm-build(1)</code> command). I wanted
to serialize the format directly from my own code, like I did for Pacman and Debian packages.</p>
<h2>How to get a package format right</h2>
<p>Before we get to RPM, let’s have a brief look at how a sane package format looks like. I always use the package for
<code>tree(1)</code> as a sample because it’s a small package with just one executable and maybe a manpage that’s available on
every distribution.</p>
<pre><code>$ file -kr tree_1.7.0-3_amd64.deb
tree_1.7.0-3_amd64.deb: Debian binary package (format 2.0)
- current ar archive
- archive file
- data
</code></pre>
<p><code>file</code> tells us that a Debian package is actually an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_(Unix)"><code>ar</code> archive</a>. Let’s unpack it.</p>
<pre><code>$ ar x tree_1.7.0-3_amd64.deb
$ ls
control.tar.gz  data.tar.xz  debian-binary  tree_1.7.0-3_amd64.deb

$ cat debian-binary
2.0

$ tar tf control.tar.gz
./
./control
./md5sums

$ tar tf data.tar.xz | grep -v '/$'
./usr/bin/tree
./usr/share/doc/tree/copyright
./usr/share/doc/tree/TODO
./usr/share/doc/tree/changelog.Debian.gz
./usr/share/doc/tree/changelog.gz
./usr/share/doc/tree/README.gz
./usr/share/man/man1/tree.1.gz
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ar</code> archive contains three files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debian-binary</code> establishes that the package conforms to the dpkg 2.0 format.</li>
<li><code>control.tar.gz</code> contains metadata: the package name, description, dependencies to other packages, checksums, and so on.</li>
<li><code>data.tar.xz</code> contains the actual files that will be unpacked onto the root filesystem when the package is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The separation into two different subarchives is really clever: The actual application data can be compressed very
tightly with <code>xz</code>, to minimize disk space and network usage on the package mirror. The metadata is compressed with <code>gz</code>
only, so it can be accessed quickly when a repository index is being created. The files in <code>control.tar.gz</code> are simple
plain text files, so you can process them comfortably even from shell scripts:</p>
<pre><code>$ tar Oxf control.tar.gz ./control | head
Package: tree
Version: 1.7.0-3
Architecture: amd64
Maintainer: Florian Ernst &lt;florian@debian.org&gt;
Installed-Size: 100
Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.14)
Section: utils
Priority: optional
Homepage: http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/
Description: displays an indented directory tree, in color
</code></pre>
<p>So much for dpkg. Pacman packages (for Arch Linux) don’t look too different, but they only have a single archive for
everything, as opposed to the two tarballs inside a Debian package. Metadata is placed in the package as files with
special names in the root directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ tar tf tree-1.7.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
.PKGINFO
.MTREE
usr/
usr/bin/
usr/share/
usr/share/man/
usr/share/man/man1/
usr/share/man/man1/tree.1.gz
usr/bin/tree

$ tar Oxf tree-1.7.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz .PKGINFO | head
# Generated by makepkg 4.1.2
# using fakeroot version 1.20
# Thu Apr 24 18:18:51 UTC 2014
pkgname = tree
pkgver = 1.7.0-1
pkgdesc = A directory listing program displaying a depth indented list of files
url = http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/
builddate = 1398363531
packager = Giovanni Scafora &lt;giovanni@archlinux.org&gt;
size = 78848
</code></pre>
<p>The Debian approach with multiple archives is preferable, though, because you can decompress the metadata quicker. With
the single archive approach of Pacman, it might be that the metadata is put at the end of the tarball. You would then
have to decompress the whole archive (possibly over a gigabyte) to get at a few kilobytes of metadata.</p>
<p>By the way: I want to take a moment to acknowledge the outstanding <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/index.html">Debian Policy Manual</a>, which specifies every
last bit of the dpkg format in a relevant and concise manner. Kudos to everyone who contributed to it.</p>
<h2>Cracking open an RPM file</h2>
<p>Now let’s grab an RPM from <a href="https://rpmfind.net">rpmfind.net</a> and see what’s in it.</p>
<pre><code>$ file -kr tree-1.7.0-7.fc26.x86_64.rpm
tree-1.7.0-7.fc26.x86_64.rpm: RPM v3.0 bin i386/x86_64
- data
</code></pre>
<p><code>file</code> cannot tell us anything except that the RPM file actually is an RPM file. It appears that RPM is really an
original file format and not built on top of an existing format such as <code>ar</code> (for dpkg) or <code>tar</code> (for Pacman). However,
there is a <a href="http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/pkgformat.html">formal specification</a> of the RPM format, as part of the Linux Standard Base. Let’s see what we got
there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An RPM format file consists of 4 sections, the Lead, Signature, Header, and the Payload. All values are stored in
network byte order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two sentences in, and I already don’t like where this is going. Let’s start at the top. The lead section is defined by
its C declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct rpmlead {
    unsigned char magic[4];
    unsigned char major, minor;
    short type;
    short archnum;
    char name[66];
    short osnum;
    short signature_type;
    char reserved[16];
};
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how it looks in my sample. I’m highlighting the fields in alternating colors for your viewing pleasure:</p>
<pre><code>$ xxd tree-1.7.0-7.fc26.x86_64.rpm | head -n6
00000000: <span style="color:green">edab eedb</span> <span style="color:blue">03</span><span style="color:green">00</span> <span style="color:blue">0000</span> <span style="color:green">0001</span> <span style="color:blue">7472 6565 2d31</span>  ..........tree-1
00000010: <span style="color:blue">2e37 2e30 2d37 2e66 6332 3600 0000 0000</span>  .7.0-7.fc26.....
00000020: <span style="color:blue">0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</span>  ................
00000030: <span style="color:blue">0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</span>  ................
00000040: <span style="color:blue">0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</span> <span style="color:green">0001</span> <span style="color:blue">0005</span>  ................
00000050: <span style="color:green">0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</span>  ................
</code></pre>
<p>The spec tells us what everything means:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>major = 3, minor = 0</code> refers to the package format version 3.0.</li>
<li><code>type = 0</code> makes it a binary package (<code>1</code> would be a source package).</li>
<li><code>archnum = 1</code> is x86. You might interject, “but it’s actually an x86_64 package!” To which RPM replies, “32-bit,
64-bit… tomayto, tomahto.”</li>
<li><code>name</code> is misnamed and should be called <code>name_and_version_and_release</code> because these three things are mashed together
in a single field.</li>
<li><code>osnum = 1</code> indicates Linux.</li>
<li><code>signature_type = 5</code> means “Yes” as far as I can tell.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you happen to have RPM installed, you can check out <code>/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc</code> for a list of acceptable values for
<code>archnum</code> and <code>osnum</code>. Look for lines starting with <code>arch_canon</code> and <code>os_canon</code>. This file comes in really handy if you
ever need a list of every single architecture and Unix-like OS that has ever existed, anywhere.</p>
<h2>Headers inside headers</h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-file-format.html">a document on the rpm-org website</a>, the lead section used to be the only place in an RPM file for
metadata. But when you take a second look, you will notice that a lot of very important metadata is missing in it. There
is no way to specify dependencies between packages, a feature so fundamental to system package managers that I wonder
how RPM ever got by without it.</p>
<p>The RPM developers decided to ditch the lead section, leaving it in the file format only for the magic number and for
backwards compatibility. What happened next is an effect so common in software development that it has its own name: the
<em>second-system effect</em> or <em>second-system syndrome</em>. From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second-system effect proposes that, when an architect designs a second system, it is the most dangerous system
they will ever design, because they will tend to incorporate all of the additions they originally did not add to the
first system due to inherent time constraints. Thus, when embarking on a second system, an engineer should be mindful
that they are susceptible to over-engineering it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s exactly what happened. While Debian and Pacman packages use simple text files with <code>key: value</code> lines for
their metadata, the RPM spec includes a custom binary format for a key-value database. Both the signature section and
header section follow this format. My favorite part of this is that because of this, an RPM file actually has <strong>five</strong>
headers:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lead section (deprecated)</li>
<li>the signature section
<ul>
<li>the header of its key-value database</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the header section
<ul>
<li>the header of its key-value database</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key-value database’s header looks like this (comments mine):</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct rpmheader {
    unsigned char magic[4];    // must be &quot;\216\255\350\001&quot;
    unsigned char reserved[4]; // must be &quot;\0\0\0\0&quot;
    int nindex;                // number of index records
    int hsize;                 // size of storage area for data
};
</code></pre>
<p>After that comes one <em>index record</em> for each key-value pair, followed by the storage area. The index records look like
this (comments mine):</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct rpmhdrindex {
    int tag;    // the key
    int type;   // data type
    int offset; // where to find the data in the storage area
    int count;  // how many data items are stored in this key
};
</code></pre>
<p>There are a few things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The keys (or <em>tags</em> in RPM parlance) are numbers rather than strings. The <code>&lt;rpm/rpmtag.h&gt;</code> header has an enum with all
acceptable values, but please consider the environment before trying to print it. RPM 4.13 defines 318 tags (302 for
the header section and 16 for the signature section). The equivalent <code>control</code> file in a Debian package has 29 fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acceptable data types include strings, binary data, and integers of various sizes. For strings and integers, multiple
values can be stored in one tag (like an array). A unique feature of RPM is <em>translatable strings</em>: These are lists of
strings, where each item corresponds to a locale string listed in the <code>RPMTAG_HDRI18NTABLE</code> tag. Nobody seems to use
this localization function, though. In all the samples that I examined, <code>RPMTAG_HDRI18NTABLE</code> only contained one
locale, <code>C</code>, and every translatable string contained just the original English string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the fields that count stuff (<code>rpmheader.nindex</code>, <code>rpmheader.hsize</code> and <code>rpmhdrindex.count</code>) are 32 bit wide and
thus can count up to 4 billion. My code contains a <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-build/blob/v1.4/src/dump-package/impl/rpm.go#L113">witty comment</a> about the designers “planning ahead”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The header section</h2>
<p>With the storage format out of the way, let’s have a look at what data is actually stored in there. I’ll use the output
of <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-build/tree/v1.4/src/dump-package">dump-package</a>, a little inspection tool that I
wrote during this endeavor. It dumps the binary data structures into a nice and readable format. Unfortunately, the data
in the structures is not nearly as readable.</p>
<pre><code>tag 1000 (NAME): length 1

    string: 7.fc26

    translatable string: File system tree viewer

</code></pre>
<p>So far, so unsurprising. Some stuff is duplicated with the lead section (which is okay since it is considered
deprecated). Name, version and release are cleanly separated.</p>
<pre><code>tag 1010 (DISTRIBUTION): length 1
    string: Fedora Project

    string: Fedora Project

</code></pre>
<p>From the department of redundancy department.</p>
<pre><code>tag 1016 (GROUP): length 1
    translatable string: Applications/File
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>RPMTAG_GROUP</code> is listed in the LSB spec as “required”, but it doesn’t say anything about acceptable values. The
documentation for openSUSE has <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_group_guidelines">such a list</a>, but the Fedora Project Wiki says that <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines?rd=Packaging/Guidelines#Tags_and_Sections">“the Group: tag is
unnecessary”</a>.</p>
<pre><code>tag 1020 (URL): length 1
    string: http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/
</code></pre>
<p>The spec lists two tags with URLs, with incredibly helpful descriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>RPMTAG_URL</code> – Generic package information URL <br>
<code>RPMTAG_DISTURL</code> – URL for package</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, they’re both optional, so I don’t need to care.</p>
<pre><code>tag 1006 (BUILDTIME): length 1
    int32: 1472740798
tag 1007 (BUILDHOST): length 1
    string: buildvm-23.phx2.fedoraproject.org
tag 1044 (SOURCERPM): length 1
    string: tree-1.7.0-7.fc26.src.rpm
tag 1064 (RPMVERSION): length 1
    string: 4.13.0-rc1
tag 1122 (OPTFLAGS): length 1
    string: -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -grecord-gcc-switches -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1 -m64 -mtune=generic
tag 1132 (PLATFORM): length 1
    string: x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>With over 300 tags, it’s no surprise that the usefulness of many of these tags is debatable, especially considering the
recent push towards <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org">reproducible packages</a>.</p>
<p>The usefulness curve quickly goes downhill:</p>
<pre><code>tag 1124 (PAYLOADFORMAT): length 1
    string: cpio
tag 1125 (PAYLOADCOMPRESSOR): length 1
    string: xz
tag 1126 (PAYLOADFLAGS): length 1
    string: 2
</code></pre>
<p>This tells us that the payload is a CPIO archive, compressed with XZ. You know, because there
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">no way at all to infer this from the payload itself</a>. Fun fact: This part of the dump shows that this Fedora
RPM is actually <em>not LSB-compliant</em>. The LSB spec states clearly that the payload compressor must be <code>gzip</code>, and that
<code>RPMTAG_PAYLOADFLAGS</code> must be <code>9</code>. If you’re wondering what payload flags are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tag indicates the compression level used for the Payload.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve reached negative usefulness values.</p>
<p>By now, you might be wondering: RPM files may have sections, with two sections having their own headers that define a
key-value database, with several keys of dubious utility. But do you have anything in store for a true connaisseur of
byzantine complexity? Well, say no more!</p>

<p>A <code>changelog.txt</code> is for filthy peasants. Real men store their changelog in a structured key-value database. I don’t
understand why they didn’t split <code>RPMTAG_CHANGELOGNAME</code> into author name, author e-mail and package version, though.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
<p>Every package format I looked at knows four types of relations to other packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>depends/requires (the other thing, or something providing the other thing, needs to be installed when this one is installed)</li>
<li>provides (the reverse of depends, basically)</li>
<li>conflicts (this one and the other thing may not be installed at the same time)</li>
<li>obsoletes (if the other thing is installed, replace it with this one during upgrades)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how RPM does package relations:</p>
<pre><code>tag 1047 (PROVIDENAME): length 2
    string: tree
    string: tree(x86-64)
tag 1112 (PROVIDEFLAGS): length 2
    int32: 8 = 0x8 = 0o10
    int32: 8 = 0x8 = 0o10
tag 1113 (PROVIDEVERSION): length 2
    string: 1.7.0-7.fc26
    string: 1.7.0-7.fc26
</code></pre>
<p>Each relation is split into three fields: the other package’s name and version, and some flags. Now if this were a
Debian package, this part would look like</p>
<pre><code>

</code></pre>
<p>because it’s extremely obvious that <code>tree</code> and <code>tree(x86-64)</code> are provided by the x86_64 package that’s literally
called <code>tree</code> and nobody would ever want to write that down. If you wonder what the <code>RPMTAG_PROVIDEFLAGS</code> are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/** \ingroup rpmds

<p>The name of the enum is probably a typing error because there is no sense anywhere to be found in RPM. But let’s look at
the values… Zero is any, that makes sense. Then we have less, greater, equal… so far so good. Bit 4 is unused, well
some legacy is to be expected. Then we have… What? Posttrans dependencies?  Interpreter used by what? rpmlib feature
what what? And what the fuck is a keyring dependency?!?</p>
<p>As you can see, I can’t explain every last bit of this, and documentation ranges from sparse to non-existent. But I can
enlighten you on a particular bit in this field, <code>RPMSENSE_RPMLIB</code>. Let’s look at the dependencies this package
requires:</p>
<pre><code>tag 1048 (REQUIREFLAGS): length 11
    int32: 16384 = 0x4000 = 0o40000

<p>I have no idea why there are six dependencies to different versions of <code>libc.so.6</code>, and why they encoded the version in
the name field rather than in the version field.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve been told that these strange libc dependencies refer to different ABIs supported by the same libc
binary. That’s somehow even worse than what I was imagining.</p>
<p>But the thing that’s even more brilliant is the four dependencies below
that. The flags include the <code>RPMSENSE_RPMLIB</code> bit from before, and the names are all like <code>rpmlib(SomeThing)</code>. Let’s
write them down more nicely:</p>
<pre><code>rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) = 3.0.4-1
rpmlib(FileDigests) = 4.6.0-1
rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) = 4.0-1
rpmlib(PayloadIsXz) = 5.2-1
</code></pre>
<p>These dependencies are not actually dependencies. They are parsed by RPM (hence the flag name “rpmlib”) and trigger
certain behavior.</p>
<p>Let me quickly recap how we got here: We are inside the third section of a file format, in a key-value database
describing the package contents, in a very specific and completely unrelated part of the database, and people suddenly
start embedding structure information about the package itself in it.</p>
<p>I literally can’t even.</p>
<p>(The only way I can explain this is that the dependency field is something that’s readily accessible to packagers and
flexible enough to store build options without breaking older RPM implementations that try to read the spec.)</p>
<p>What are these version strings about, you say? Nothing. Just <a href="https://github.com/Distrotech/rpm/blob/0fad88f82bc278cb4788993164f49b97feb78031/build/files.c#L1114">arbitrary, hard-coded values</a> that must be
replicated bit by bit if you want to generate a valid RPM. Please take a moment to let this sink in: The version field
is filled with arbitrary magic numbers where it is irrelevant, but empty for the glibc dependencies where it would
actually make sense.</p>
<p>And of course, the <code>PayloadIsXz</code> dependency is a duplicate of <code>RPMTAG_PAYLOADCOMPRESSOR</code> that we saw earlier. The word
you’re looking for right now is “fractal clusterfuck”.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
<p>We haven’t covered the largest group of tags in this header section. I’ll copy-paste it in its
entirety for you to appreciate in its grace and beauty.</p>

<p>This would be even longer if I hadn’t chosen a small package with only four files and one directory in it. The RPM
header section includes the entire filesystem metadata of every single file or directory in its payload, down to device
numbers for device files. You know, because there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#Header">no way at all</a> to store this information in a
tarball…</p>
<p>Granted, though, there are some useful things in here. For example, <code>RPMTAG_FILEMD5S</code> corresponds to the <code>md5sums</code> file
in a Debian package’s <code>control.tar.gz</code>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why this list up there contains all conceivable sorts of filesystem metadata, but not the
file names themselves. That’s because I saved the best for last. Remember the <code>rpmlib(CompressedFileNames)</code> dependency
from earlier? Here’s what it means:</p>

<p>Someone must have thought really hard about how to shave some bytes off your regular RPM header, and after failing to
come up with one of the few dozen obvious options, decided to deduplicate the directory names in the file name list.
Here’s how to read it: Every file (or directory) has its basename in the first list, and a directory index in the second
list. The directory index goes into the third list and yields the dirname for the basename. Without “compressed file
names”, we would instead see:</p>
<pre><code>tag 1027 (OLDFILENAMES): length 5
    string: /usr/bin/tree
    string: /usr/share/doc/tree
    string: /usr/share/doc/tree/LICENSE
    string: /usr/share/doc/tree/README
    string: /usr/share/man/man1/tree.1.gz
</code></pre>
<p>I don’t say that this compressed encoding will not save some bytes for large packages that have a lot of files in a few
directories, but it’s a weird place to start optimizing when there’s so much low-hanging fruit. For one, everything that
we saw so far is stored in the RPM file <strong>entirely uncompressed</strong>. Only the payload (i.e. the actual files and
directories) has <code>xz</code> or LZMA compression.</p>
<p>I already said that I saved the best for last before I showed you the compressed file names, but it’s just so hard to
choose the best part of this mess. So here’s my other candidate:</p>
<pre><code>tag 63 (HEADERIMMUTABLE): length 16
    00000000  00 00 00 3f 00 00 00 07  ff ff fc 60 00 00 00 10  |...?.......`....|
</code></pre>
<p>Until now, all the fields were pretty obvious, and their meaning could be inferred more or less directly from my
samples (except for the dependency flags, but the relevant ones are actually defined in the spec). But the
<code>RPMTAG_HEADERIMMUTABLE</code> field had me stymied for quite some time. The spec has this to say about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tag contains an index record which specifies the portion of the Header Record which was used for the calculation of
a signature. This data shall be preserved or any header-only signature will be invalidated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because I could not establish a relationship between these words up there and the 16 bytes of data in the tag, I looked
through the source code of rpm-org (thus marking my final descent into madness), and found this concept under the name
“region”.  I’ll just copy-paste a comment from my implementation because it captures my original bewilderment perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t fully grasp the meaning, but it appears that a region tag marks a set of header tags and data that are to be
considered immutable, i.e.  they may be used for validation purposes, such as calculating hash digests and signatures.
I hope that I’m wrong, because this would imply that RPM has a concept of “metadata that’s okay to manipulate even if
the package is GPG-signed”, which is insane even for RPM’s standards.  However, from what I’ve seen in the
implementation, their regions always seem to span the whole header structure, therefore marking everything as
immutable.</p>
<p>We do the same thing. The index record for the region tag is at the <em>start</em> of the index record array, and its data is
located at the <em>end</em> of the data area. The data is another index record that (using a negative offset into the data
area) points back at the original index record. (I’m tempted to use the word “insane”, but it feels like I use that
word so often when talking about RPM that it has lost all meaning.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The signature section</h1>
<p>Another thing that sets RPM apart from other package formats is that it includes signatures right in the file, rather
than e.g. a detached GPG signature in a separate file.</p>
<p>Some of the signatures go over the header section, so they cannot go into there. So there is a signature section before
the header section. And again, it’s a key-value database. Let’s see what’s in it.</p>
<pre><code>tag 62 (HEADERSIGNATURES): length 16
    00000000  00 00 00 3e 00 00 00 07  ff ff ff 80 00 00 00 10  |...&gt;............|
</code></pre>
<p>Another region tag that works the same way as above.</p>
<pre><code>tag 269 (SHA1): length 1
    string: 268371792c4ffd4e716111a182176c6922ae55ce
tag 1004 (MD5): length 16

</code></pre>
<p>The SHA-1 checksum goes over the header section. The MD5 checksum goes over the header section plus the payload. Also,
the first one is a hex-encoded string, the second one is binary data.</p>
<pre><code>tag 1000 (SIZE): length 1
    int32: 52270
tag 1007 (PAYLOADSIZE): length 1
    int32: 100168
</code></pre>
<p>These two are even weirder: <code>RPMSIGTAG_SIZE</code> is the byte count for the header section plus the <em>compressed</em> payload.
<code>RPMSIGTAG_PAYLOADSIZE</code> is the byte count for the <em>uncompressed</em> payload.</p>

<p>Don’t let the names fool you. These are both RSA signatures, formatted as a Version 3 Signature Packet as specified in
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2440">RFC 2440: OpenPGP Message Format</a>. <code>RPMSIGTAG_RSA</code> goes over the header section, <code>RPMSIGTAG_PGP</code> goes over the
header section plus payload.</p>
<p>And if doubly sure is not enough for you, you can be quadruply sure and add <code>RPMSIGTAG_DSA</code> and <code>RPMSIGTAG_GPG</code>, which
are the same deal, but with DSA instead of RSA signatures. Nobody uses them anymore, though.</p>
<p>But as always, I’ve saved the best for last. There’s one last tag in this signature section that I want you to stare at
and admire like a piece of art:</p>

<p>While you stare and admire, recall that all of this is stored completely uncompressed.</p>
<p>Since I don’t know what to say anymore, I’ll leave you with this little gem that I found in the C headers of RPM.
Because if you’re anything like me, you hate when your files have the wrong color.</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * File States (when installed).
 */
typedef enum rpmfileState_e {
    RPMFILE_STATE_MISSING	= -1,	/* used for unavailable data */
    RPMFILE_STATE_NORMAL 	= 0,
    RPMFILE_STATE_REPLACED 	= 1,
    RPMFILE_STATE_NOTINSTALLED	= 2,
    RPMFILE_STATE_NETSHARED	= 3,
    RPMFILE_STATE_WRONGCOLOR	= 4

    <p>I'm <strong>Stefan Majewsky</strong> aka <strong>Xyrill</strong>. I hold a diploma in theoretical physics, but have been working in IT since graduation. At work, I take pride in replacing complex distributed systems by very small shell scripts. After work, I complain about the weather, politics, crappy devices, and literally everything else. I can also be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanmajewsky">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/majewsky">GitHub</a>.
