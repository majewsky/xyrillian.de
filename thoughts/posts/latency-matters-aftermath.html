<p>1 megabit per second? That’s lower than I anticipated, even with all the size optimizations that I implemented (or let’s
just say, all the bloat that I purposefully did not add). Same goes for CPU usage: I’ve heard so many people on the
internet complain about how expensive TLS handshakes are, yet my virtual server handles all of this with less than six
percent of a single core. It’s barely even visible on the CPU usage chart, and completely drowned out by noise on the
load chart.</p>

    <p>I'm <strong>Stefan Majewsky</strong> aka <strong>Xyrill</strong>. I hold a diploma in theoretical physics, but have been working in IT since graduation. At work, I take pride in replacing complex distributed systems by very small shell scripts. After work, I complain about the weather, politics, crappy devices, and literally everything else. I can also be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanmajewsky">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/majewsky">GitHub</a>.
