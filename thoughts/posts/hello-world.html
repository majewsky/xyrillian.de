  <main><h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I had known for a long time that I need a new blog. I had one years ago in the cloud
(<a href="https://majewsky.wordpress.com">itâ€™s still live</a>), but I definitely wanted something self-hosted this time. I had a
brief look at static website generators, and quickly decided that (as usual) I want a custom-tailored solution.</p>
<p>The first iteration is an nginx serving static files rendered by a
<a href="https://github.com/majewsky/blog-generator">tiny Go program</a>. Content comes from a
<a href="https://github.com/majewsky/blog-data">GitHub repo</a> and is pulled every few minutes. Good enough for a first shot.
I might change the cronjob to be triggered by a GitHub webhook later on, but only if the delay until the next cronjob
run annoys me enough.</p>

    <p>I'm <strong>Stefan Majewsky</strong> aka <strong>Xyrill</strong>. I hold a diploma in theoretical physics, but have been working in IT since graduation. At work, I take pride in replacing complex distributed systems by very small shell scripts. After work, I complain about the weather, politics, crappy devices, and literally everything else. I can also be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanmajewsky">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/majewsky">GitHub</a>.
