<p>When you visit this blog, the connection will be encrypted and thus
tamper-proof thanks to a free TLS certificate from
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let’s Encrypt</a>. They’re currently running a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/donate/">crowdfunding campaign</a> to
fund their operational costs. Since I use their service extensively, I gave 50
dollars. If you, too, like the idea of a more secure and privacy-respecting

    <p>I'm <strong>Stefan Majewsky</strong> aka <strong>Xyrill</strong>. I hold a diploma in theoretical physics, but have been working in IT since graduation. At work, I take pride in replacing complex distributed systems by very small shell scripts. After work, I complain about the weather, politics, crappy devices, and literally everything else. I can also be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanmajewsky">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/majewsky">GitHub</a>.
