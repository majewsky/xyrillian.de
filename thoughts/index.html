  <article><h1><a href="/thoughts/posts/golang-api-design.html" title="Permalink">[l]</a> Notes on API design in Go</h1>
<p>At work, I have a working student who’s implementing some features in the various Golang applications that I build and maintain. I’m trying to pass some of my experience with real-world programming on to him, and <a href="https://github.com/sapcc/go-bits/pull/2">one particular pull request review</a> escalated into a blog post on API design, so I might as well share it here for archival purposes (and to fill the desolate wasteland that is my RSS feed).</p>
<p>The concern of the pull request was to add a function to a utility library that implements exponential backoff. His proposed API looked like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">//Retry takes a function (action) that returns an error, and two int64 values (x, y) as
//parameters and creates a retry loop with an exponential backoff such that on failure (error return),
//the action is called again after x seconds and this is incremented by a factor of 2 until y minutes
//then it is keeps on repeating after y minutes till action succeeds (no error).
func Retry(action func() error, x, y time.Duration) { ...  }
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a> comes into full force today. I
took the opportunity to add a data privacy statement to the blog. Here is it
in its full glory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No system under my control records any personal data of users of this website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true because I disabled the nginx access log a long time ago, and
because I restricted the nginx error log to not report 404 errors. So the logs
are basically empty now (except for alert messages from nginx). <a href="https://github.com/majewsky/system-configuration/blob/da7f81133dee981f771dafd3c066ad28e7a09a8f/hologram-nginx.pkg.toml#L102-L103">These are the
relevant lines in my nginx config.</a></p>
<p>No idea why any blogger would be panicking about GDPR.</p>
<p>Side-note: Even though I choose not to wiretap my users’ browsers, <a href="https://blog.bethselamin.de/posts/latency-matters-aftermath.html">I still
have analytics</a>.</p>
</article><article><h1><a href="/thoughts/posts/latency-matters-aftermath.html" title="Permalink">[l]</a> Does the HN crowd show up in monitoring?</h1>
<p>So <a href="latency-matters.html">my previous post</a> made <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15059795">the frontpage on Hacker News</a>.
Awesome! I have seen many websites collapse under the load of a HN crowd, so this is the perfect time to look at the monitoring.</p>

<p>1 megabit per second? That’s lower than I anticipated, even with all the size optimizations that I implemented (or let’s
just say, all the bloat that I purposefully did not add). Same goes for CPU usage: I’ve heard so many people on the
internet complain about how expensive TLS handshakes are, yet my virtual server handles all of this with less than six
percent of a single core. It’s barely even visible on the CPU usage chart, and completely drowned out by noise on the
load chart.</p>

<p>A month ago, danluu wrote about <a href="https://danluu.com/term-latency/">terminal and shell performance</a>. In that post, he
measured the latency between a key being pressed and the corresponding character appearing in the terminal. Across
terminals, median latencies ranged between 5 and 45 milliseconds, with the 99.9th percentile going as high as 110 ms for
some terminals. Now I can see that more than 100 milliseconds is going to be noticeable, but I was certainly left
wondering: Can I really perceive a difference between 5 ms latency and 45 ms latency?</p>
<p>Turns out that I can.</p>

<p>I've noticed that a lot of gifts people give to me do not really evoke the
positive feelings that they are supposed to. This happens often enough to
warrant a blog post, in which I go through different categories of
gifts and present my subjective verdict on each of them.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that this lament is not directed towards anyone in
particular. However, there is a focus on types of gifts that are most commonly
given by family members and close relatives, since that’s where most of the
gift-giving happens.</p>

<p>I have previously noted that I get all my TLS certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let’s Encrypt</a>, but since my usage of the client
deviates quite a bit from the standard, I figured I should take a few minutes to describe my setup.</p>

<p>When you visit this blog, the connection will be encrypted and thus
tamper-proof thanks to a free TLS certificate from
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let’s Encrypt</a>. They’re currently running a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/donate/">crowdfunding campaign</a> to
fund their operational costs. Since I use their service extensively, I gave 50
dollars. If you, too, like the idea of a more secure and privacy-respecting
web, please consider giving generously, too.</p>
</article><article><h1><a href="/thoughts/posts/argh-pm.html" title="Permalink">[l]</a> Argh-P-M! – Dissecting the RPM file format</h1>
<p>As the first actual content on my new blog, let me tell you the story of how I went absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>On my private systems, I ship configuration as system packages. Every distribution has their own tooling and process for
building these packages, but I eventually grew tired of the ceremony involved in it, and wrote <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-build">my own system package
compiler</a>. Since I’m using Arch Linux everywhere, the first version generated only Pacman packages, but I
was determined to make it truly cross-distribution. The first step was support for Debian packages, which I implemented
in a mere two evenings (one for understanding the format, one for writing the generator).</p>
<p>Next to dpkg, the other widely deployed package format is RPM, so I set out to add support for RPM as well. If I could
write the Debian generator in two days, then surely RPM support wouldn’t take that long, either. Little did I know that
I was embarking on a multi-month endeavor (including multiple week-long breaks to restore my sanity). To add insult to
injury, I stubbornly refused to add dependencies and use existing tooling (i.e., the <code>rpm-build(1)</code> command). I wanted
to serialize the format directly from my own code, like I did for Pacman and Debian packages.</p>
<p class="more"><a href="/thoughts/posts/argh-pm.html">Read more...</a></p></article><article><h1><a href="/thoughts/posts/rss.html" title="Permalink">[l]</a> Blog Update: RSS</h1>
<p>While I was at it, I added an <a href="https://blog.bethselamin.de/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>
and changed the timestamps on an article’s page to reflect the
<a href="https://github.com/majewsky/blog-data">git-log of the source file</a>.</p>
</article><article><h1><a href="/thoughts/posts/hello-world.html" title="Permalink">[l]</a> Hello World</h1>
<p>I had known for a long time that I need a new blog. I had one years ago in the cloud
(<a href="https://majewsky.wordpress.com">it’s still live</a>), but I definitely wanted something self-hosted this time. I had a
brief look at static website generators, and quickly decided that (as usual) I want a custom-tailored solution.</p>
<p>The first iteration is an nginx serving static files rendered by a
<a href="https://github.com/majewsky/blog-generator">tiny Go program</a>. Content comes from a
<a href="https://github.com/majewsky/blog-data">GitHub repo</a> and is pulled every few minutes. Good enough for a first shot.
I might change the cronjob to be triggered by a GitHub webhook later on, but only if the delay until the next cronjob
run annoys me enough.</p>
